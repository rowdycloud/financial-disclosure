# Account Definitions and File Mappings
# Copy this file to accounts.yaml and customize for your accounts.
#
# Usage: cp accounts_sample.yaml accounts.yaml
#
# The tool can also create accounts.yaml interactively when it encounters
# unmapped files. Use --no-interactive to skip unmapped files instead.
