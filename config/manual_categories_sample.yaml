# Manual Category Overrides
# Copy this file to manual_categories.yaml and add your specific overrides.
#
# Usage: cp manual_categories_sample.yaml manual_categories.yaml
#
# Manual overrides take precedence over automatic categorization rules.
# Use this for transactions that are incorrectly categorized by rules
# or for one-off transactions that don't fit any rule.

# Override matching logic:
# A transaction matches when ALL specified criteria match:
# - date: exact match (required)
# - amount: exact match (required)
# - keywords: at least one keyword matches description (case-insensitive substring)
#
# If multiple overrides match, highest priority wins; ties resolved by list order.

overrides:
  # Example: Reclassify an ambiguous Amazon purchase
  # - date: "2024-03-15"
  #   amount: -52.43
  #   keywords: ["AMAZON"]
  #   category: "groceries_alcohol"
  #   subcategory: null
  #   priority: 100

  # Example: Mark a one-time large purchase
  # - date: "2024-06-20"
  #   amount: -1500.00
  #   keywords: ["BEST BUY"]
  #   category: "home_goods"
  #   priority: 100

  # Example: Reclassify a transfer that was incorrectly categorized
  # - date: "2024-01-05"
  #   amount: -500.00
  #   keywords: ["VENMO", "JOHN DOE"]
  #   category: "dining"  # Actually split a restaurant bill
  #   priority: 100

  # Example: Business expense that looks like personal
  # - date: "2024-07-12"
  #   amount: -89.99
  #   keywords: ["OFFICE DEPOT"]
  #   category: "misc_expense"
  #   priority: 100

# Tips for using manual overrides:
#
# 1. Be as specific as possible with keywords to avoid matching
#    multiple transactions unintentionally.
#
# 2. Use the exact amount including sign (-negative for expenses).
#
# 3. Higher priority values are evaluated first. Use 100+ for
#    critical overrides that must take precedence.
#
# 4. After running the tool, check the "Uncategorized" flag in
#    the output to find transactions that may need manual overrides.
#
# 5. You can add multiple keywords to match a specific transaction:
#    keywords: ["AMAZON", "WHOLE FOODS", "PRIME"]
#    This matches if ANY of the keywords appear in the description.
